array-callback-return:
  usefulness: 2
  details: |
    Array has several methods for filtering, mapping, and folding. If we forget to write return statement in a callback of those, it’s probably a mistake. If you don’t want to use a return or don’t need the returned results, consider using .forEach instead.
  assessment: |
    Could be useful to flag out potential errors.

'for-direction':
  usefulness: 3
  details: |
    A for loop with a stop condition that can never be reached, 
    such as one with a counter that moves in the wrong direction, will run infinitely. 
    While there are occasions when an infinite loop is intended, the convention is to construct such loops as while loops. 
    More typically, an infinite for loop is a bug.
